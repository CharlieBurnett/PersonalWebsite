            <h3>About Me</h3>
            
            <p>
                I absolutely love to work on projects that use technology to have a positive social impact. While that might sound a bit cliche, I hope the sections below can show that I speak the truth.
            </p>
            
            <strong>Currently: </strong>
                
            <p> 
                I work at Salesforce where I run product for all things offline related to the various mobile apps we have.
                It is my job to make sure that our clients have what they need on their device to get their job done, whether its providing essential medical services, ensuring essential machinery continues to function, 
                or that Small Businesses can strengthen their sales.
            </p>

            <strong>Previously:</strong>

            <p>
                As a Product Manager at Asurion, I delivered a data driven customer support site that impacted millions of US Telecom customers around the globe. 
                The tool helped customers troubleshoot connection issues in their homes not just with their phones but with all types of computer or IoT Devices.
                As an engineer, I also worked on a proactive IoT security monitoring smart home device. The goal was to use Machine Learning to detect problems before they occured or became bigger issues.
            </p>    

            <p>
                At Mimo, I contracted as an iOS Developer to help create and optimize an app that teaches anyone how to code. 
            </p>
                At Sandboxx, I was the lead iOS Engineer working on an app that empowered Military families to communicate with their children while they serve as Soldiers. 
                Our app was built to improve the military mail process, achieving our goal of getting letters sent faster and into the hands of the right people, while maintaining the Military standard for encryption.
            </p>

            <p>
                At CloudMine, I worked with their incredibly talented team to support their mission to provide HIPPA compliant cloud services to medical professionals in need everywhere. 
                I helped transition their technology from Objective-C to Swift and ensured their backend was able to import increasingly complex data sources.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Idea Evolver, being my very first professional gig I was simultaneously intern, first employee, and Lead iOS Developer. I build from scratch an entire application that helped gamify the SEO experience for the SEO of Fortune 500 Companies.
